#Project Description

Depression and a pining for help is something that has hit its all-time high, and the likeliness of developing symptoms related to Depression is 3 times as likely before the Covid pandemic struck according to studies. This is the niche where we hope to effectively work, having a platform to provide stimulation based on their interests.

This project aims to reach all those who are undergoing mentally strenuous times, an escape from the toxic fakeness of all the social media running rampant on the net now. The main intent of the project is to provide a respite from all this mental pressure by making the user spend time with the things that destress him/her.

The main reason why this project is essential is because of how desperately people need a safe space where they can just be themselves without any distractions and just let their hearts out, having some alone time for themselves with this age of social business.

The main benefit of this project will be for those who forget to make time for themselves. It will also benefit those undergoing tremendous mental strain and all those who feel alone or those who feel different. Our project also aims at connecting all those who are undergoing the same issues so that they will finally feel as if they have company.

We aim to do this by creating a website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
